title = 'How I Learned Korean from Level 1 to TOPIK 6 in 10 Months'
+++

This post details my journey of learning the Korean language from complete beginner to TOPIK 6 in approximately 10 months. I'll try to be as detailed as possible about my experience and strategies.

In January 2023, I received the Global Korea Scholarship for a Software Engineering degree at Ajou University in South Korea. Since studying in Korea required Korean proficiency, I began learning the language that same month.

## Starting Out: The Foundation Phase

As a first step, I enrolled in two basic Korean courses from different learning centers in Myanmar, both conducted online. Looking back, I should point out that taking two separate courses for Korean basics was unnecessary—one would have been sufficient.

After about two months of study, I arrived in Korea at the end of February 2023 to begin my Korean Language Course at Ajou University. Despite completing two basic courses in Myanmar, I couldn't skip Level 1 in Korea and had to start all over again. This experience made me realize that to learn a language as quickly and effectively as possible, immersion is key—living in the country where the language is spoken makes all the difference. It's all about the environment.

## The Intensive Learning Phase

I started the Level 1 course at Ajou in March 2023. However, unlike most of my classmates, I decided to attempt the TOPIK II test during my Level 2 studies, which is still below intermediate level. As expected, TOPIK was much more difficult than I had imagined, but I pushed through and achieved TOPIK Level 3—the minimum requirement to begin degree coursework in Software Engineering at Ajou University. Students have one year to reach TOPIK Level 3 before starting the degree program, and I accomplished this in just five months.

For my second attempt, I took TOPIK II again during my Level 3 language course in September. In fact, I took two TOPIK II tests during my Level 3 semester—one in September and another in October. I achieved TOPIK 5 and TOPIK 6, respectively. This progression happened within 10 months of starting my Korean language studies.

## My TOPIK Preparation Strategy

Here's how I approached TOPIK preparation at different stages:

### First Attempt (Level 2 → TOPIK 3)

Until Level 2, I primarily focused on school lectures and textbooks. I didn't stress too much about understanding every vocabulary word and grammar point in the TOPIK test. During the Listening and Reading sections, I maintained full attention while being mindful of time limits, checking the clock every 5 to 10 minutes.

The crucial point for these sections is that you can't waste time trying to understand every question and passage 100%—that's not the main objective. The goal is to select the correct answer. If you're unsure, make your best guess and move on to the next question. Don't let stress overwhelm you during the exam. Maintaining a calm mindset is essential.

For the Writing section, since I didn't know most (honestly, almost all) Korean words in the test, producing quality writing within the 50-minute time limit was impossible. So I made a strategic decision to skip question 54, which comprises the main part of the writing test and accounts for 50% of the total writing marks. Since I couldn't understand the question at all, I refused to become stressed or worried about it. Instead, I focused on questions 51, 52, and 53.

Questions 51 and 52 also depend on reading comprehension, so I simply did what I could. For question 53, I memorized useful writing templates that I found online and got from friends. I memorized these templates and wrote down as much as I could remember. Did I make many errors in writing? Of course—many mistakes. But writing something was better than writing nothing, and keeping calm throughout the test helped me avoid careless mistakes.

### Second and Third Attempts (Level 3 → TOPIK 5 & 6)

For my second and third TOPIK attempts, I dedicated 60-70% of my time to school lectures and only 30-40% to TOPIK test preparation (timing practice, strategy development, etc.). By this time, I was in Level 3 of my school curriculum and could understand about 50-60% of the words in TOPIK. I believe my strong focus on schoolwork enabled me to improve my Korean language skills reasonably quickly.

Unlike my first TOPIK attempt, I now studied the questions carefully and developed appropriate strategies to excel within my capabilities. Whenever I wasn't attending school lectures, I practiced with timed TOPIK mock tests, especially for Reading and Writing, since these sections can be challenging due to time constraints.

For Reading, I focused on questions I could understand, which were mostly at the beginning (up to around question 35). For the remaining questions, depending on available time, I either made educated guesses or selected random answers.

For the Writing test, I allocated my time strategically:
- **3 minutes** for question 51
- **5 minutes** for question 52  
- **12 minutes** for question 53
- **30 minutes** for question 54

Yes, this time I tackled question 54, as it's essential when aiming for TOPIK 5 or 6. Whenever I studied for TOPIK, I timed myself as if it were the actual exam. Additionally, I obtained notes from my university's TOPIK class, which contained useful vocabulary and grammar patterns that frequently appear on the test.

The key to my success was maintaining focus on my regular Korean studies while strategically preparing for the test format and timing constraints.
