## Courses Overview
The courses are demanding, but rewarding as expected. Since I am thinking about pursuing the Machine Learning career, I am giving more focus to mathematics subjects such as Linear Algebra 1 and Probability and Statistics 1. Sometimes, I find the formula derivation and theory proofs a little bit challenging. Maybe because throughout my whole academic journey I have focused more on application of theories, rather than trying to understand why some theories are the way they are. I need to develop my critical thinking skills more. 

During the past week in Algorithms class, we have learned two algorithms: Insertion Sort and Merge Sort. I feel like the class is moving quite slowly since the professor sometimes takes too long to explain a concept. She tries her best to explain the concepts in English but I feel like I should have listened to her Korean class.

Other subjects such as Computer Networks are very interesting as well. My only hope is that in case of subjects like Computer Networks, the exams should be open-book with the questions about the practical usage of concepts from the textbook. But memorization is also fine for me. 

## Week Two Highlights
I have applied for International Students' Union at Ajou University and am having the interview tomorrow. Still a black-box journey ahead, but I hope I can improve my communication and idea delivering skills. 

## Goals for Next Week
1. **Use 5-minutes rule more**
2. **Read textbooks more**
3. **Pass International Students' Union Interview**
4. **Code More**

*During next week, I am expecting updates on our group's application for the "Study Group" program. We are planning to create a recommendation system throughout the semester and it would be really cool if we got accepted.*
