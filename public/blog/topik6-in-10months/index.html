      How I Learned Korean from Level 1 to TOPIK 6 in 10 Months

  <div class="post-content"><p>This post details my journey of learning the Korean language from complete beginner to TOPIK 6 in approximately 10 months. I&rsquo;ll try to be as detailed as possible about my experience and strategies.</p>
<p>In January 2023, I received the Global Korea Scholarship for a Software Engineering degree at Ajou University in South Korea. Since studying in Korea required Korean proficiency, I began learning the language that same month.</p>
<h2 id="starting-out-the-foundation-phase">Starting Out: The Foundation Phase<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#starting-out-the-foundation-phase">#</a></h2>
<p>As a first step, I enrolled in two basic Korean courses from different learning centers in Myanmar, both conducted online. Looking back, I should point out that taking two separate courses for Korean basics was unnecessary—one would have been sufficient.</p>
<p>After about two months of study, I arrived in Korea at the end of February 2023 to begin my Korean Language Course at Ajou University. Despite completing two basic courses in Myanmar, I couldn&rsquo;t skip Level 1 in Korea and had to start all over again. This experience made me realize that to learn a language as quickly and effectively as possible, immersion is key—living in the country where the language is spoken makes all the difference. It&rsquo;s all about the environment.</p>
<h2 id="the-intensive-learning-phase">The Intensive Learning Phase<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-intensive-learning-phase">#</a></h2>
<p>I started the Level 1 course at Ajou in March 2023. However, unlike most of my classmates, I decided to attempt the TOPIK II test during my Level 2 studies, which is still below intermediate level. As expected, TOPIK was much more difficult than I had imagined, but I pushed through and achieved TOPIK Level 3—the minimum requirement to begin degree coursework in Software Engineering at Ajou University. Students have one year to reach TOPIK Level 3 before starting the degree program, and I accomplished this in just five months.</p>
<p>For my second attempt, I took TOPIK II again during my Level 3 language course in September. In fact, I took two TOPIK II tests during my Level 3 semester—one in September and another in October. I achieved TOPIK 5 and TOPIK 6, respectively. This progression happened within 10 months of starting my Korean language studies.</p>
<h2 id="my-topik-preparation-strategy">My TOPIK Preparation Strategy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#my-topik-preparation-strategy">#</a></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I approached TOPIK preparation at different stages:</p>
<h3 id="first-attempt-level-2--topik-3">First Attempt (Level 2 → TOPIK 3)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#first-attempt-level-2--topik-3">#</a></h3>
<p>Until Level 2, I primarily focused on school lectures and textbooks. I didn&rsquo;t stress too much about understanding every vocabulary word and grammar point in the TOPIK test. During the Listening and Reading sections, I maintained full attention while being mindful of time limits, checking the clock every 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The crucial point for these sections is that you can&rsquo;t waste time trying to understand every question and passage 100%—that&rsquo;s not the main objective. The goal is to select the correct answer. If you&rsquo;re unsure, make your best guess and move on to the next question. Don&rsquo;t let stress overwhelm you during the exam. Maintaining a calm mindset is essential.</p>
<p>For the Writing section, since I didn&rsquo;t know most (honestly, almost all) Korean words in the test, producing quality writing within the 50-minute time limit was impossible. So I made a strategic decision to skip question 54, which comprises the main part of the writing test and accounts for 50% of the total writing marks. Since I couldn&rsquo;t understand the question at all, I refused to become stressed or worried about it. Instead, I focused on questions 51, 52, and 53.</p>
<p>Questions 51 and 52 also depend on reading comprehension, so I simply did what I could. For question 53, I memorized useful writing templates that I found online and got from friends. I memorized these templates and wrote down as much as I could remember. Did I make many errors in writing? Of course—many mistakes. But writing something was better than writing nothing, and keeping calm throughout the test helped me avoid careless mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="second-and-third-attempts-level-3--topik-5--6">Second and Third Attempts (Level 3 → TOPIK 5 &amp; 6)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#second-and-third-attempts-level-3--topik-5--6">#</a></h3>
<p>For my second and third TOPIK attempts, I dedicated 60-70% of my time to school lectures and only 30-40% to TOPIK test preparation (timing practice, strategy development, etc.). By this time, I was in Level 3 of my school curriculum and could understand about 50-60% of the words in TOPIK. I believe my strong focus on schoolwork enabled me to improve my Korean language skills reasonably quickly.</p>
<p>Unlike my first TOPIK attempt, I now studied the questions carefully and developed appropriate strategies to excel within my capabilities. Whenever I wasn&rsquo;t attending school lectures, I practiced with timed TOPIK mock tests, especially for Reading and Writing, since these sections can be challenging due to time constraints.</p>
<p>For Reading, I focused on questions I could understand, which were mostly at the beginning (up to around question 35). For the remaining questions, depending on available time, I either made educated guesses or selected random answers.</p>
<p>For the Writing test, I allocated my time strategically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 minutes</strong> for question 51</li>
<li><strong>5 minutes</strong> for question 52</li>
<li><strong>12 minutes</strong> for question 53</li>
<li><strong>30 minutes</strong> for question 54</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this time I tackled question 54, as it&rsquo;s essential when aiming for TOPIK 5 or 6. Whenever I studied for TOPIK, I timed myself as if it were the actual exam. Additionally, I obtained notes from my university&rsquo;s TOPIK class, which contained useful vocabulary and grammar patterns that frequently appear on the test.</p>
<p>The key to my success was maintaining focus on my regular Korean studies while strategically preparing for the test format and timing constraints.</p>
