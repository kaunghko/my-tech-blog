## Course Overview

This semester, I am taking the following courses:

1. **Algorithms**
2. **Computer Structures**
3. **Computer Networks**
4. **Linear Algebra 1**
5. **Probability and Statistics 1**
6. **Introduction to Open-source Software**

## First Impressions

### The Good
This semester, I am very excited because this marks the beginning of my journey toward becoming a machine learning engineer. I am taking courses like Linear Algebra and Probability, which are fundamental to the field.

### The Challenging
I expect this semester to be very demanding but rewarding, especially since I am taking 18 credits of major subjects. I will do my best to stay on top of all the concepts and maintain a strong academic performance.

## Goals for This Semester

### Academic Goals
- Maintain or improve my previous semester's GPA of 4.48/4.5
- Master the core concepts in each course
- Build a strong foundation for machine learning

### Personal Goals
- Achieve a healthy study-life balance
- Eliminate the "I'll do this later" mindset across all aspects of my life
- Strengthen personal relationships and maintain extracurricular activities

## Week One Highlights

During the first week, I successfully caught up with all of my coursework (though the workload was still light). I also took the opportunity to improve and revitalize my personal relationships with important people in my life.
